							Flask is an implementation of the web frameworks concept.

							Flask is considered more Pythonic than the Django web framework because in common situations the equivalent Flask web application
							is more explicit. Flask is also easy to get started with as a beginner because there 
							is little boilerplate code for getting a simple app up and running.
